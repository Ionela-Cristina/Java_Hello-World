                + " " + size + " " + origin + " " + material + " " + noun + " " + purpose);//changing also the place here has changet the output
//here I observed how changing changing the order of things affect the output if you don't modify also the the "condition"?
//changing the size with opinion then the output works without moving place in the declaration of of the variable
    


/** Final result
5.0 yellow AWESOME new oblong teensy-weensy Martian platinum dragons good
